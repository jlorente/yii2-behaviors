Yii2 Behaviors (Development Phase)
==================================

A compilation of useful behaviors for the Yii2 framework.

## Included Behaviors

**ActiveOrderBehavior** - A behavior to handle a sorting field in models of the 
same type.
**EnhancedAttributeBehavior** - Acts like the attribute behavior but allows that 
attributes could depend on attributes in the related models.

## Installation

Include the package as dependency under the composer.json file.

To install, either run

```bash
$ php composer.phar require jlorente/yii2-behaviors "*"
```

or add

```json
...
    "require": {
        // ... other configurations ...
        "jlorente/yii2-behaviors": "*"
    }
```

to the ```require``` section of your `composer.json` file.
